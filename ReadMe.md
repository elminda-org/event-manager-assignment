# Welcome to Elminda code exercise

You need to implement an event manager that expose two methods:
 1. registerEvent (eventName, callBack)
 2. fire(eventName)
 
The eventName is a string and callBack is a function to be called once the event is fired.

## What to do?

1. Clone the repository 
2. run npm install
3. Write your code in file src/eventManage.js
4. Run the test to track your progress by running "npm run test"

Bonus:
Implement unregister method that unregister a specific callback for event name and implement a unitest for it in file test\eventManager.test.js.

Good luck,
